-      A popup surface is a short-lived, temporary surface that can be
-      used to implement menus. It takes an explicit grab on the surface
-      that will be dismissed when the user dismisses the popup. This can
-      be done by the user clicking outside the surface, using the keyboard,
-      or even locking the screen through closing the lid or a timeout.
-
-      When the popup is dismissed, a popup_done event will be sent out,
-      and at the same time the surface will be unmapped. The xdg_popup
-      object is now inert and cannot be reactivated, so clients should
-      destroy it. Explicitly destroying the xdg_popup object will also
-      dismiss the popup and unmap the surface.
-
-      Clients will receive events for all their surfaces during this
-      grab (which is an "owner-events" grab in X11 parlance). This is
-      done so that users can navigate through submenus and other
-      "nested" popup windows without having to dismiss the topmost
-      popup.
-
-      Clients that want to dismiss the popup when another surface of
-      their own is clicked should dismiss the popup using the destroy
-      request.
-
-      The parent surface must have either an xdg_surface or xdg_popup
-      role.
-
-      Specifying an xdg_popup for the parent means that the popups are
-      nested, with this popup now being the topmost popup. Nested
-      popups must be destroyed in the reverse order they were created
-      in, e.g. the only popup you are allowed to destroy at all times
-      is the topmost one.
-
-      If there is an existing popup when creating a new popup, the
-      parent must be the current topmost popup.
-
-      A parent surface must be mapped before the new popup is mapped.
-
-      When compositors choose to dismiss a popup, they will likely
-      dismiss every nested popup as well.
